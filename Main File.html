        This is a tool that allows you to customize an instrument to assess suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 
        <p><b>The problem this tool is addressing:</b> There is a huge diversity in instruments used to assess suicidal thoughts and behaviors that makes it difficult to aggregate data or compare findings across studies. Instruments use a wide array of different questions and response options to measure the same constructs. More comprehensive instruments assess different characteristics of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, such as onset, frequency, and controllability of suicidal thoughts. However, researchers often have limited space to assess suicidal thoughts and behaviors in their study, and thus select instruments due to their brevity. </p>
        <p><b>What this tool offers:</b> This tool allows researchers to customize the length of the instrument and select which provides flexibility in terms of length and characteristics assessed, while also making it easier for researchers to use standardized items, in terms of the wording of the questions and the response options. This will allow for easy aggregate and comparison across study. </p>

            <h2><u>Section 1: Suicidal thoughts</u></h2>
            <p><b>How to use this tool:</b> Below are three different types of suicidal thoughts. Having respondents answer multiple questions about suicidal thinking increases the validity of their responses. Therefore, these three items are required. However, beyond these three types of suicidal thoughts, <b><i>you can customize this instrument. </i></b> </p>
            <p>You can select to have the instrument assess several characteristics of suicidal thinking, such as the intensity, frequency, controllability, and duration of suicidal thoughts, as well as their onset and most recent occurrence. </p>
            <p>Start here by selecting which thoughts will have their <u>characteristics</u> assessed. The instrument can include characteristics for all three types of suicidal thinking or a subset of them. </p>
